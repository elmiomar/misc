# HOWTO

After reading the Twilio quickstart guide and getting a phone Number, install flask and twilio:

```
pip install flask
pip install twilio
```

Go to the examples folder in your PyNDN2 root folder, create your Receiver file, and copy paste the code from receive.py.

Open a terminal and run the receiver code:

```
python receive.py
```

The receiver needs a publicly accessible URL. We will use [ngrok](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/6-awesome-reasons-to-use-ngrok-when-testing-webhooks.html) to open a tunnel to our local machine.
Ngrok generates a forwarding URL that we will use to redirect requests from Twilio to our application.

Open the phone number configuration screen in your Twilio console. Scroll down to the “A MESSAGE COMES IN” field and paste the URL that was generated by ngrok: `http://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/sms`.

In another terminal:

```
ngrok http 5000
```

You are all set and ready to send/receive SMS to/from your NDN network.

> **Note**: use the phone number provided by twilio.
